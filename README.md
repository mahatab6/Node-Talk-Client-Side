## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js (LTS) and a package manager installed (npm / yarn / pnpm). Optionally install [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) if you will clone the repo.

---

## Environment variables

Place environment variables in a `.env` file at the project root. Depending on your toolchain you may need `VITE_` or `REACT_APP_` prefixes ‚Äî use whatever your build system expects. Example `.env.example`:

```env
# API & backend
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
# or REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=

# Firebase
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=app_id

# Stripe (frontend)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Optional
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=
```

---

## Run locally (step-by-step)

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone <FRONTEND_REPO_URL>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
# npm
npm install
# or yarn
# yarn
# or pnpm
# pnpm install
```

3. **Copy env example and fill values**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and add your values (Firebase, API url, Stripe publishable key)
```

4. **Start the dev server**

```bash
# npm (common scripts)
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

5. **Open in browser**

```
http://localhost:5173   # or 3000 depending on setup
```

> If the frontend expects a running backend, follow the backend README (link at top) and start it before testing protected flows (like Stripe webhooks or authenticated routes).

---

## Run with the backend

1. Clone and start the backend:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahatab6/Node-Talk-Server-Side
cd Node-Talk-Server-Side
# follow the server README to run it (install envs, start)
```

2. Point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (or `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`) to your backend host (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).

3. Start both services and test full flows (auth, posting, Stripe membership). If you use Stripe webhooks, consider `ngrok` to expose the backend for webhook testing.

## Build & deploy

**Build**

```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
```

**Deploy**

* Netlify or Vercel work well for SPA frontends. Connect your Git repository and set environment variables in the hosting dashboard.
* For Netlify, ensure the build command matches your `package.json` and the publish directory is `dist` (vite) or `build` (CRA).

**Tip:** Use branch previews for PRs and enable automatic redeploys for the `main` branch.

---

## Project roadmap

* Real-time notifications (mentions, replies)
* Post analytics dashboard (views, growth charts)
* Tag-based topic pages
* Admin activity logs & audit trail
* Improved moderation tools & reporting UI

---

## Contributing

1. Create an issue describing the feature or bug.
2. Fork the repo, create a branch: `feature/your-feature-name`.
3. Make changes, write tests where appropriate.
4. Open a PR and reference the issue.

Add a short `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for clarity.

---

## Helpful tips to make the README stand out

* Add 1‚Äì2 GIFs showing the most important flows (post creation + payment flow).
* Use a short demo video or Loom link.
* Add badges (build, netlify, license, issues) at the top.
* Show `npm` install & run command examples with copy-to-clipboard buttons (if you host README on a static site).
* Add a short "How to test" section for QA steps (create user, create post, upgrade to premium, check admin panel).
